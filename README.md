## Anomaly-Detection

Anomaly Detection Challenge is a practical [course](https://www.sec.in.tum.de/anomaly-detection-challenges/) organized by TUM Security Chair. A competition on discovering the anomalies is conducted on kaggle to test the performance of several machine learning algorithms.
The challenges and their dataset is as follows:

* Challenge 1 - [Image anomaly detection](https://inclass.kaggle.com/c/adcg-2016-image-anomaly-detection)
* Challenge 2 - [Review Anomaly Detection](https://inclass.kaggle.com/c/adcg-2016-review-anomaly-detection)
* Challenge 3 - [Network Anomaly Detection](https://inclass.kaggle.com/c/adcg-2016-network-anomaly-detection)
* Challenge 4 - [Malware Anomaly Detection](https://inclass.kaggle.com/c/adcg-2016-malware-anomaly-detection-w-peinfo)
* Challenge 5 -  Malware Enigma
